So I think that this is a super cool idea, not because I've ever played guild wars but because I've ran into the ghost town that is old online games. It's super lame. So I think that it's cool to try to combat that! Though I don't have a lot of skills right now, I would like to contribute my skill of learning new skills to this project. You know, figure out what needs to be done and then learn how to do it. 
As far as the business side of things, I've always thought that game wiki's and resources out to be free and maintained by people who love the game. Ad revenue would be cool though. 
I don't know how you would go about gathering all the data that you need. Is it all readily availiable on the game? Would the creators of Guild Wars be okay with you gathering data from their game like this? Perhaps they wouldn't like a 24-hour playing bot taking up their server resources. I think that it would be a good idea to ask for permission to start this type of project. 
Would this be a one shot type of thing? Once you got general prices for things, you could turn the data gatherer off. Or perhaps update weekly. That would take less resources and make it significantly easier data-base side. Once a week there would be and update or something like that. Since I don't know the game I can't really imagine what things will be like technically right now, but there is probably going to be a couple ways of doing things.
