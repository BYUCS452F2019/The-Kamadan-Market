# The-Kamadan-Market
This app will record player to player transactions for older games which don't already have this feature build in. Not sure what an item is worth in the game? This is where you can look it up.

# Problem
This idea was spawned when my brothers and I returned to an old game called Guild Wars. In this online game, the unofficial trading capital is a city called Kamadan, hence the title of this project. Unfortunately, there is no actual database that keeps records of recent item values/trades, and since it is an older game with fewer players, prices are inflated from when we last played, so we have no idea what costs are reasonable.

# Solution
Create an application (which could be extended to other online games without this feature built in) which reports the current trade values for different items. It will include real-time player postings, as well as postings from when people logged off. To take this feature even further, a player could choose to register an account with us so they can post an item for sale without even having to log onto the game in order to put it up for sale. Another registered user may bid/purchase the item.

# Team
Looking for a max team size of 3 people (including myself).

# Technical
Since this app targets older generations of online games, the best technical setup is a SPA. Registration is free but not required. People won't want to download an app and register for a quick item lookup. 

Frontend:
React.js

Backend:
Probably Node.js, but I'm open to suggestions.

SQL Database:
Probably MySQL, but MariaDB and PostgreSQL are open for discussion.

NoSQL:
I have no real hands on experience with NoSQL, so I'm open to suggestions.

# Business
This is a hobby driven activity and is therefore free. If you wanted to monetize the app, the best route would probably be minimally invasive ads.

# Legal
This is a free application, and all information will be considered public knowledge except for private user account info/passwords. The idea is that this would be community built and open-source.
